A test project for the game 4story and its private servers, the main purpose of the project was to try out java awt(mainly the class robot), opencv and some other niche librarys such as Tesseract.

The bot is made to bypass the original captcha from 4classic that required you to solve a math ecuation and it makes you to donate experience frequently so you won't level up.

Note, if you want to actually use the bot, you need to run it from your compiler.
