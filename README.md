A test project for the game 4story and its private servers, the main purpose of the project was to try out java awt(mainle the class robot), opencv and some other niche librarys such as Tesseract.

The bos is made to bypass the original captcha from 4classic that required you to solve a math ecuation and it makes you to donate experience frequently so you wont level up.

Note, if you want to actually juse the bot, you need to run it from your compiler and might not pass some of the captcha.
